## Introduction

The following is an anectdote that is representative of an "ah-ha" moment that has led me to where I am currently at in my career, and continues to push me forward.

## The setup

I was at VMworld 2015 attending a panel discussion titled _"Why Automation isn't Automagic"_. It was paneled by people from Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Microsoft. The discussion centered around how traditional IT Ops could transition to an automation oriented environment. Time and time again the audience members asked _"How can we change our existing environmental structure when we are told over and over again "No." by management"_. The panel offered various options of grassroots efforts to show the
company why automation is truly the future for IT Ops. Finally, Jeffrey Snover, who was sitting on the panel for Microsoft,
spoke up and offered this

> "Change your Company or change your company."

## Ah-ha!

What a straight forward idea! Change your Company, ie create an automation first environment, or change your company and find an organization that is receptive to an automation oriented Ops.

So that's what I did. For several months I worked to convert my existing environment. I grew as an individual but my efforts were falling on deaf ears within the organization so I started the second phase of Snover's advice and started looking to
change my company. In my interviews I repeated the above anectdote and told of how I was tired of clicking "next". I no longer wanted to be a "Left-click Engineer". I wanted to focus on automation and I wanted to continue to grow as an individual and employee.

It has been almost a year since I changed jobs and I honestly haven't been happier. In that time I have learned a lot and I hope
to share my experiences here. What works, what doesn't, concepts, etc. See you in the next post.
